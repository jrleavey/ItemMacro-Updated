This is a lightweight update of the original Item Macro module by Kekilla, Forien, and Honeybadger.

The goal of this version is to provide compatibility with Foundry VTT v12+ and introduce native support for the DnD5e Activity system, including a new activity type: "Macro".

All credit for the core functionality and design of this module goes to the original authors. This update simply preserves and expands their excellent work for continued use in modern Foundry versions.
